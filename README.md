The magic broad appears everywhere.


## Build & Develop
You should configure some options before you start. see [HACKING](./HACKING.md).

We use [yarn classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) to manage packages. We have planned to migrate to yarn v2 soon.

````shell
yarn && yarn build
````

See `package.json` for some helper scripts.
